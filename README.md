Hey! Welcome to My-Helper!

## To Get Started

I then updated the repository readme once again.

It will be something to simplify the start of developing any application that I need to carry out, a bootstrap, bringing some ready-made components such as button, dropdown, text area, text input, table, among others... I will build the base with nextJs, jest and tailwind. In the future

I will make this readme more presentable hehehe :)
